# APG: Accelerated Proximal Gradient in R
## Jean-Philippe Vert

APG is an R package to solve convex but potentially non-smooth optimization problems with an accelerated proximal gradient.

It implements basic functions for least-squares and logistic regression with lasso, elastic net, group lasso or monotonicity constraints, and allows the user to easily implement extensions.

Check the (vignette)[vignettes/apg_vignette.Rmd] for examples.
